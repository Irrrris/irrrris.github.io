### Likelihood Function 
Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a likelihood function, so that under the assumed statistical model the observed data is most probable (Wiki). In real world, the data we obtain are always the samples which would not have exact parameters, which we need to have an estimation to gather a most possible result.
